"""
API-key authentication -- closes the "No API authentication exists" gap named in
docs/security-notes.md and docs/production-readiness-review.md since Phase 12/31.

Deliberately simple: a single shared secret in API_KEY, checked against the
X-API-Key request header via constant-time comparison (secrets.compare_digest --
a naive `==` string comparison leaks timing information about how many leading
characters matched, which is a real (if narrow) side-channel for guessing a secret).

Not built: per-client keys, key rotation, scopes/roles. Named explicitly as a
reasonable next step in docs/security-notes.md, not silently out of scope.

/health is intentionally exempt (see src/api/main.py) -- health checks are
conventionally unauthenticated so a load balancer or orchestrator can probe
liveness without needing a credential, a standard and deliberate exception, not an
oversight.
