"""
Per-client API keys with named roles, closing the gap this file's own prior
docstring named explicitly: "Not built: per-client keys, key rotation, scopes/roles."

Configuration: API_KEYS env var, comma-separated `name:key:role` triples, e.g.
    API_KEYS=analyst:abc123:reader,ci-pipeline:def456:reader,admin:ghi789:admin
A malformed entry (wrong number of `:`-separated parts) is skipped rather than
crashing the whole app on a typo -- one bad entry in a long list shouldn't take
every other configured key down with it.

Backward compatible: the original single-secret API_KEY env var still works if set
(mapped to a synthetic client named "default" with role "admin"), so an existing
deployment's already-configured API_KEY doesn't silently stop working when this
ships -- this project's live Render deployment is exactly that case.

Rotation: revoke a compromised key by removing its entry from API_KEYS and
redeploying -- no code change needed, same operational model the single-key
version already had.

Roles: currently every route in this project is read-only (GET), so a role
distinction doesn't gate different permissions yet the way it meaningfully would
in a project with write endpoints -- but per-client keys are still real, valuable
API surface on their own (revoke one caller's access without rotating everyone
else's key, know which client made a given request from logs). require_role()
exists so a future write endpoint (or operations-assistant, which does have one --
POST /documents) can gate on it immediately, not as unused scaffolding.

/health is intentionally exempt (see src/api/main.py) -- health checks are
conventionally unauthenticated so a load balancer or orchestrator can probe
liveness without needing a credential, a standard and deliberate exception, not an
oversight.
