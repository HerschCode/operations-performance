# Build Plan — Operations Performance

24-phase roadmap (Project 1 of 2; Project 2 is `operations-assistant`, phases 13-24 of the combined
plan live there). See `FEATURES.md` for the full tiered feature spec this plan builds toward.

**All 12 phases of Project 1's core plan are done.** Remaining work is Tier 2/3 items from
`FEATURES.md` (dashboard actually built in a BI tool, `sql/analysis/*.sql`, API auth) rather
than a numbered phase -- see "What's left" at the bottom of this file.

## Status by phase (elevated 24-phase plan -- see chat history for full phase-by-phase text)

| # | Phase | Status | Key files |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Foundations (ingestion/validation/cleaning) | done | `src/ingestion/`, `src/cleaning/` |
| 2 | Data modeling & Postgres | done | `sql/schema/`, `scripts/setup_database.py` |
| 3 | Core process analytics | done | `cycle_time.py`, `bottlenecks.py`, `sla_analysis.py`, `process_variants.py`, `conformance.py`, `rework.py`, `root_causes.py`, `supplier_analysis.py`, `docs/analytical-methodology.md` |
| 4 | Predictive layer | done | `src/ml/features.py`, `train.py` (time-based split), `predict.py`, `explain.py`, `docs/ml-model.md` |
| 5 | Data pipeline hardening | done | `src/ingestion/data_contract.py`, `sql/schema/003_create_pipeline_runs.sql`, `scripts/run_pipeline.py`, `tests/test_ingestion.py` |
| 6 | Analytics API layer | done | `src/api/main.py`, `routes.py`, `schemas.py`, `db.py`, `tests/test_api.py` |
| 7 | Dashboard & reporting | done | `src/reports/generate_summary.py`, `generate_management_report.py`, `GET /reports/management`, `dashboard/README.md` (build spec), `tests/test_reports.py` |
| 8 | Cloud migration (BigQuery/GCP) | done | `cloud/bigquery/schema.sql`, `tables.sql`, `scripts/migrate_to_bigquery.py`, `cloud/README.md` (Postgres vs BigQuery comparison) |
| 9 | Testing & CI | done | All 7 test files real (44 tests, all genuinely passing -- ran the full suite, not just assumed it would pass), `.github/workflows/test.yml` CI on push/PR, `pyproject.toml` filled in with pytest/ruff config |
| 10 | Observability | done | `src/observability/logging_config.py` (structured JSON logs), `scripts/run_pipeline.py` wired with per-stage timing, `src/api/middleware.py` (per-request logging + X-Request-ID), `GET /observability/pipeline-runs`, `tests/test_observability.py` |
| 11 | Documentation & governance | done | All `docs/` files filled in: `project-overview.md` (index/front door), `business-requirements.md`, `data-dictionary.md`, `data-quality-report.md`, `data-contract.md`, `process-model.md`, `cloud-architecture.md` (pointer to `cloud/README.md`), `findings-and-recommendations.md` (pointer to `GET /reports/management`, deliberately not duplicated). `sql-analysis.md` still a stub -- depends on `sql/analysis/*.sql` actually being written first, so left honest rather than pre-filled. |
| 12 | Security & access review | done | `sql/schema/004_create_roles.sql` (3 least-privilege Postgres roles, applied manually by an admin -- see below), `src/api/db.py` (dedicated `API_DB_USER`/`API_DB_PASSWORD`, falls back to pipeline credential), CORS fixed to `API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var instead of `*`, `docs/security-notes.md` (explicit, bounded -- says what's NOT covered too) |

## Phase 7 notes worth remembering
- `generate_summary.py` and `generate_management_report.py` are separate on purpose: the summary
  is just numbers (what the Executive Overview dashboard page needs), the management report adds
  the Finding -> Evidence -> Impact -> Recommendation narrative on top. Both are built from the
  exact same underlying `src/analytics/` functions -- no separate "reporting" logic that could
  drift from what the dashboard/API show.
- The report generator is **template-driven, not LLM-generated** -- every number is exact and
  traceable back to a specific analytics function, which matters more here than prose polish.
  (An LLM-written version of this belongs in `operations-assistant`'s investigation mode later,
  not here -- Project 1 stays deterministic.)
- `_bottleneck_finding`, `_rework_finding`, `_conformance_finding`, `_sla_driver_finding` each
  return `None` gracefully when their underlying data isn't available (e.g. no `config/process.yaml`
  yet) rather than crashing the whole report -- the report degrades gracefully as more analytics
  come online.
- `dashboard/README.md` is a full page-by-page build spec (data source, visuals, which endpoint
  feeds each page) since the actual `.pbix`/Looker file can't live in this environment -- that's
  the honest deliverable here.
- Page 5 (Conformance) and Page 6 (SLA Risk distribution) in the dashboard spec reference two
  endpoints that don't exist yet (`GET /metrics/conformance`, `GET /metrics/sla-risk-distribution`)
  -- flagged directly in the spec rather than silently assumed.
- `GET /reports/management` is the new endpoint -- same report the CLI script produces, exposed
  over HTTP so it's rerunnable and, later, callable by `operations-assistant`.

## Phase 5 notes (still relevant)
- Idempotency via `if_exists="replace"` per table inside a single DB transaction. A higher-volume
  production system would more likely upsert on `case_id` instead -- worth knowing that trade-off.
- `data_contract.py` (shape check, fail fast) is deliberately separate from `validate_input.py`
  (content check, warn and proceed).
- `pipeline_runs` logs failures too -- `status='failed'`, `error_message` populated, not swallowed.

## Phase 6 notes (still relevant)
- Endpoints so far: `GET /health`, `GET /metrics/cycle-time`, `GET /metrics/bottlenecks`,
  `GET /metrics/sla`, `GET /suppliers/performance`, `GET /orders/{case_id}/risk`,
  `GET /reports/management`.
- The API never reimplements analysis -- it loads from Postgres and calls the same
  `src/analytics/`/`src/ml/`/`src/reports/` functions everything else uses.
- `tests/test_api.py` mocks DB access so the suite runs without a live Postgres instance.

## Phase 8 notes worth remembering
- Migration is deliberately two-step: `cloud/bigquery/schema.sql` creates partitioned/clustered
  tables and views first; `scripts/migrate_to_bigquery.py` loads data into them. The script
  itself flags that `load_table_from_dataframe(autodetect=True)` alone does NOT apply
  partitioning -- running the migration script without first running schema.sql produces an
  unpartitioned table that will cost more to query. This ordering dependency is real and worth
  stating plainly if asked, not glossed over.
- `cloud/README.md` is the actual interview artifact here -- a direct Postgres-vs-BigQuery
  comparison (partitioning/clustering replacing indexes, APPROX_QUANTILES vs PERCENTILE_CONT,
  cost model, when you'd pick which). It also says plainly that this dataset doesn't actually
  need BigQuery's scale -- the migration exists to demonstrate the skill, not because Postgres
  was insufficient. That honesty is itself a better interview signal than overclaiming necessity.

## Phase 9 notes worth remembering -- two real bugs, actually caught
Running the suite (not just writing it) caught two genuine bugs before they'd have surfaced
in an interview or a real run:
1. **`_count_out_of_order` in `data_quality.py` was sorting by timestamp before diffing** --
   which silently fixed the exact problem it was supposed to detect and always reported zero
   out-of-order events. Fixed by diffing in the data's given order, not sorted order.
2. **`data_contract.py` pinned dtype checks to `'object'`**, which broke under pandas 3.0 (this
   environment's installed version), where the default string dtype changed to `'str'`.
   Fixed with `pd.api.types.is_string_dtype`/`is_object_dtype` instead of a name-pinned
   equality check -- version-stable rather than version-specific.
Both are exactly the kind of thing worth mentioning in an interview if asked "did you test
this" -- not just "yes", but "yes, and it caught two real bugs, here's what they were."

## Phase 10 notes worth remembering
- Logs are structured JSON, not free text -- every line is one `json.dumps()` call
  (`JsonFormatter`), so log aggregation tools (or a plain `jq` pipe) can query them, not just
  a human skimming a terminal.
- `run_pipeline.py` now times every stage (load/contract/validate/clean/load_db) individually
  and logs a duration for each, plus a final total -- this is what would let you actually
  answer "why did last night's run take longer" instead of just "it finished", which is the
  actual point of observability over just logging.
- API requests get a short `request_id` (returned as an `X-Request-ID` response header) so a
  single request's log line is correlatable if it touches more than one thing later.
- `GET /observability/pipeline-runs` surfaces the Phase 5 `pipeline_runs` audit table over
  HTTP -- previously that table existed but nothing outside direct DB access could see it;
  now it's actually usable as a health signal.
- Ran the full suite again after these changes (not assumed) -- 49/49 passed clean on the
  first run this time, which is a reasonable signal the Phase 9 fixes were correct fixes and
  not lucky ones.

## Phase 11 notes worth remembering
- Two docs are deliberately **pointers, not duplicated content**:
  `findings-and-recommendations.md` points at `GET /reports/management` (live data, would
  drift if hand-copied) and `cloud-architecture.md` points at `cloud/README.md` (avoids two
  copies of the Postgres-vs-BigQuery reasoning going out of sync). This mirrors the same
  discipline used throughout the code -- one source of truth, referenced, not copied.
- `data-contract.md` is explicitly an honesty statement: real BPI 2019 event data, clearly
  separated from synthetic business rules (SLA targets, expected process sequence, policy
  docs). Worth reading verbatim before an interview -- it's the exact answer to "is this real
  data."
- `sql-analysis.md` is left as a stub on purpose -- it documents `sql/analysis/*.sql`, which
  itself is still one-line stubs. Writing the doc before the SQL exists would mean describing
  queries that don't exist yet, which is worse than an honest placeholder.
- Ran the full test suite again after all doc changes (docs shouldn't touch code, but checked
  anyway) -- still 49/49.

## Phase 12 notes worth remembering
- **`sql/schema/004_create_roles.sql` is deliberately NOT run automatically** by
  `scripts/setup_database.py` -- it needs superuser/CREATEROLE privileges the app's own
  `DB_USER` shouldn't have, and it uses psql-style `:'variable'` password substitution the
  script's naive semicolon-splitting SQL runner can't handle (it would also choke on the
  file's `DO $$ ... $$` block). `setup_database.py` explicitly skips this file and prints a
  note on how to run it manually via `psql -v`. This was caught and fixed while writing the
  file, not after -- worth remembering as another example of the 'run it and see' discipline
  from Phase 9, applied to SQL this time instead of Python.
- `src/api/db.py` now prefers a dedicated `API_DB_USER`/`API_DB_PASSWORD` over the pipeline's
  write credential, with a fallback to `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD` for simple local dev before
  roles exist. This is real code behavior, not just a doc claiming least-privilege --
  covered by `tests/test_observability.py`'s two credential-fallback tests.
- `docs/security-notes.md` explicitly lists what's NOT covered (no API auth, no rate limiting,
  no dependency scanning yet) rather than implying completeness -- that list is itself the
  more honest and more interview-useful artifact than a security doc that claims the system
  is hardened.
- Ran the full suite one more time after these changes: **51/51 passing** (49 + 2 new
  credential tests).

## What's left (Tier 2/3, not phase-gated)
- `sql/analysis/*.sql` -- still one-line stubs; SQL equivalents of `src/analytics/`, then
  `docs/sql-analysis.md` can be written for real
- `GET /metrics/conformance`, `GET /metrics/sla-risk-distribution` -- needed for dashboard
  pages 5-6
- The dashboard itself, actually built in Power BI/Looker Studio against the running API
  (`dashboard/README.md` is the build spec)
- API authentication (Tier 3 in `FEATURES.md`, explicitly out of scope for this pass, noted
  in `docs/security-notes.md`)
- **The single most valuable next step, unchanged from every earlier note in this file:**
  actually run this against a live Postgres instance with a real BPI 2019 export. Nine of the
  twelve phases went through real bug-catching (Phase 9's two, Phase 12's `setup_database.py`
  fix); the parts that haven't been run against real data are exactly the parts still most
  likely to have something to find.

## Companion project status
`operations-assistant`'s Phase 13 (backend foundations) and Phase 14 (document corpus + RAG
ingestion) are now done -- see that repo's own `PLAN.md`. Its Phase 16 (structured-data tools)
will call this project's `src/api/` endpoints directly, so nothing here needs to change for that
to work -- the API was built with exactly that consumer in mind back in this project's Phase 6.

## Explicitly deferred, not forgotten
`src/cleaning/clean_orders.py`, `src/transformation/build_orders.py`,
`src/transformation/build_process_metrics.py`, `src/analytics/scenario_analysis.py` -- nothing in
the pipeline currently needs a separate "orders" table distinct from `clean_events.py`/
`build_process_cases.py`. Don't build these speculatively -- revisit only if a real need shows up,
otherwise delete rather than let them sit empty.


## Phase 25 audit (post-completion, cross-project consistency + reproducibility check)
Ran a systematic audit against the actual code, not the docs' claims about it -- checked every
item in both projects' feature checklists against real files, and checked for undeclared
dependencies (would a fresh clone + `pip install -r requirements.txt` actually work).

**Confirmed accurate (no doc/code drift found)**: every analytics/ML/API file the docs claim
exists, does. The three items already documented as NOT done (SHAP, `sql/analysis/*.sql` real
content, an actually-built dashboard file) are genuinely not done -- no overclaiming found.

**Two real, small bugs found and fixed by this audit**:
1. `src/ingestion/validate_input.py`'s `__main__` block used `from load_event_log import
   load_event_log` -- a bare import that only works if run from inside `src/ingestion/`, unlike
   every other file's `__main__` block (14 of them), which consistently uses
   `from src.ingestion.load_event_log import load_event_log`. Would have thrown
   `ModuleNotFoundError` if someone ran `python -m src.ingestion.validate_input` from the repo
   root, the way the rest of the codebase is meant to be run. Fixed to match the consistent
   pattern.
2. `pydantic` is imported directly in `src/api/schemas.py` but was never explicitly listed in
   `requirements.txt` -- it happened to work because FastAPI pulls it in transitively, which is
   fragile (a future FastAPI version could change or unpin that). Added as an explicit direct
   dependency, since code that imports something directly should declare it directly.

Cross-project consistency also re-verified: `config/sla.yaml`'s targets (3-way match: 10 days,
Consignment: 14 days, default: 10) still match `operations-assistant/data/documents/sla-policy.md`
exactly, as designed back in that project's Phase 14.

Full suite reran clean after both fixes: 51/51.


## Phase 27 -- Data correctness audit (golden dataset, hand-verified)
Built `data/golden/golden_raw_events.csv` (7 cases, deliberately designed to hit every
conformance deviation type plus rework and a clear SLA breach/supplier ranking) and hand-derived
every metric -- cycle time percentiles, SLA breach rate, rework rate, conformance rate, supplier
scorecard, and the full bottleneck stage-duration table -- with a calculator in
`docs/data-correctness-audit.md`, before running any code. `tests/test_data_correctness.py` then
proves the real pipeline produces those exact numbers.

**This found a real, previously-undetected bug**, not just a discrepancy in the hand math:
`conformance.py`'s out-of-order check compared a case's activities (with duplicates left in)
against the deduplicated expected sequence, so a list-length mismatch meant **any repeated
activity -- even an explicitly allowed one -- always triggered a false `out_of_order` deviation**.
This meant `allowed_repeats` (e.g. multiple Goods Receipt events for a multi-line PO) never
actually worked for conformance checking, only for the separate rework check in `rework.py`. Fixed
by deduplicating before the comparison; a new assertion in `test_conformance_matches_hand_calculation`
guards against it regressing. `docs/analytical-methodology.md`'s conformance section updated to
describe the corrected (and now correct) behavior.

Full suite after the fix: 62/62 (51 previous + 11 new correctness-audit tests).

Why a golden dataset rather than auditing real BPI 2019 data: this environment has no real
dataset loaded. A hand-verifiable set is arguably the more rigorous check anyway -- you can't
independently verify an 18.4% breach rate on a real dataset by hand; every number in this audit
was computed independently of the code, which is what makes it possible for the audit to catch a
bug the unit tests (written by looking at the same code being tested) didn't.


## Phase 28 -- End-to-end scenario tests (3 of 5 canonical scenarios live here)
`tests/test_e2e_scenarios.py` traces 3 of the 5 canonical business scenarios through the real
FastAPI route layer -- real Pydantic request/response validation, real analytics/ML functions --
against the Phase 27 golden dataset (scenarios 1-2, where the correct answer is independently
known) or a purpose-built larger synthetic set (scenario 3, since the 7-case golden set is too
small to train/test meaningfully). Only the database layer is mocked (`load_cases`/`load_events`
return DataFrames directly rather than querying live Postgres, since none is available here) --
everything from that boundary outward is genuine production code.

- **Scenario 1** ("identify the biggest bottleneck"): `GET /metrics/bottlenecks` against the
  golden dataset returns exactly the hand-derived answer from Phase 27
  (`docs/data-correctness-audit.md`) -- "Purchase Requisition -> Approval", 41.857h avg.
- **Scenario 2** ("which supplier has the worst SLA performance"): `GET /suppliers/performance`
  correctly identifies S3 as worst, matching Phase 27's hand derivation exactly.
- **Scenario 3** ("is this order likely to breach SLA"): a real model trained on a purpose-built
  synthetic set (not the golden set -- too small), then `GET /orders/{case_id}/risk` against a
  case built from the high-risk end of the feature distribution correctly returns an elevated
  risk level. The assertion is deliberately about the scenario's shape (risk correctly identified
  as elevated), not an exact probability -- a trained model's output isn't something to
  hand-derive the way Phase 27's deterministic analytics are.

Scenarios 4 (policy retrieval) and 5 (the flagship combined question) live in
`operations-assistant/tests/test_e2e_scenarios.py` and `docs/e2e-scenarios.md` -- they use a real
(if network-restricted-workaround) retrieval chain that doesn't apply here.

Full suite after Phase 28: 65/65 (62 previous + 3 new scenario tests).


## Phase 30 -- Performance & cost pass
Built `scripts/benchmark_pipeline.py` -- real, runnable timing of every pipeline stage, against
either the golden dataset or a generated synthetic set at any scale
(`python -m scripts.benchmark_pipeline --synthetic --n-cases 2000`).

**Found and fixed a real, significant performance bug**: `rework_by_case` took 978ms at 2,000
cases, 8-40x slower than sibling functions doing comparable work -- caused by a Python-level loop
over every case (`for case_id, group in events.groupby("case_id")`) instead of one vectorized
groupby. Rewritten; re-benchmarked at 9.93ms -- a ~98x speedup, dropping total pipeline time from
1,248ms to 277ms for 2,000 cases. Correctness reverified against the Phase 27 golden dataset after
the rewrite -- unchanged. `check_conformance` has the identical loop shape and is now the slowest
remaining stage (128ms); deliberately NOT rewritten in this pass since its per-case logic is
harder to vectorize safely than rework's simple count comparison, and doing it carelessly right
after fixing a real correctness bug in the same area (Phase 27) risked introducing a new one.
Documented as a known, non-urgent opportunity in `docs/performance-notes.md`.

**Also found (by actually running the benchmark script, not by inspection): every script in this
repo's documented invocation was broken.** `python scripts/run_pipeline.py` (exactly what
`README.md` told people to run) fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`, because
running a script by path puts its own directory on `sys.path`, not the repo root -- so every
`from src...` import in the codebase failed. This had been broken since Phase 0 and was never
caught because every prior verification ran through pytest (which sets `pythonpath=["."]` in
`pyproject.toml`), never through the actual documented command a real user would type. Fixed by
adding `scripts/__init__.py` and switching every documented invocation to `python -m scripts.foo`;
`README.md` now explains why. **This is arguably the single most consequential finding across all
27 phases of auditing/correctness/performance work** -- every other bug found was in a specific
metric or edge case; this one meant the primary documented way to run the entire system didn't
work, for anyone, the whole time.

Full suite unaffected: 65/65.

## Phase 29 (agent correctness audit) note
Phase 29 lives in `operations-assistant` -- see that repo's `PLAN.md` and
`src/evaluation/generate_agent_report.py`.


## Phase 31 -- Production-readiness review
`docs/production-readiness-review.md` -- four perspectives (Data, Application, AI, Operations),
each question answered honestly against the actual code, "partially" and "no" included where
true. See operations-assistant's own review for its half of the combined system.

## Phase 32 -- Freeze v1.0
`CHANGELOG.md` (what's in v1.0, every real bug found during the build, known limitations stated
plainly) and `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` (a real backlog, not a todo list disguised as done). No git
repo exists in this environment to actually run `git tag` -- both files include the exact command
to run once this code is under real version control.

**All 32 phases across both projects are now complete or explicitly, honestly partial where
named.** Final test totals: 65/65 here. The single remaining unknown, unchanged in substance
since it was first named several phases ago: neither project has ever run against real
infrastructure -- a live Postgres instance, a real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, the two services actually
talking to each other. That is not phase 33. It is the one thing left before v1.0 is more than a
frozen, thoroughly-audited, never-executed system.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- closing high/medium-impact backlog items
Done after the v1.0 freeze, on request: real SQL for all 7 `sql/analysis/*.sql` files (previously
one-line stubs); `docs/sql-analysis.md` filled in, including an honest explanation of why
`conformance.sql` is deliberately partial. Dead stub files removed rather than left empty in a
frozen repo (`sql/transformations/*.sql`, `build_orders.py`, `build_process_metrics.py`,
`clean_orders.py`, `scenario_analysis.py`, `ml/evaluate.py`) -- all were genuinely never going to
be built for v1.0 and are tracked in `FUTURE_IMPROVEMENTS.md` instead of sitting as clutter.

Two new API endpoints: `GET /metrics/conformance` and `GET /metrics/sla-risk-distribution` --
unlocking dashboard pages 5-6 (previously blocked, per `dashboard/README.md`) and
`operations-assistant`'s `process.py` tools (previously empty, waiting on exactly this). 4 new
tests, including one asserting the conformance endpoint against the Phase 27 golden dataset's
hand-derived numbers exactly, and explicitly checking Phase 27's `out_of_order` fix still holds
through the API layer, not just the underlying function.

Full suite: 69/69.

## Post-v1.0 build session, part 2 -- API authentication
`src/api/auth.py` -- API-key auth via `X-API-Key`, constant-time compared
(`secrets.compare_digest`, avoiding a timing side-channel a naive `==` would have). Applied to
every route except `GET /health` (split into its own `health_router`, since health checks are
conventionally unauthenticated for load-balancer/orchestrator probing). Fails open if `API_KEY`
isn't set, matching this project's existing local-dev-permissive pattern (e.g.
`API_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`'s default) -- existing tests needed zero changes as a result, confirmed by
running the full suite before writing any new test. 5 new tests genuinely exercise the missing
header / wrong key / correct key paths, not just "auth module exists."

`docs/security-notes.md` and `docs/production-readiness-review.md` updated -- "No API
authentication exists" was the most-repeated unclosed gap across both projects' security docs;
now closed, with the real remaining limitation (one shared secret, no per-client keys/rotation)
stated plainly rather than implied to be more complete than it is.

Full suite: 74/74.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- the actual live run (Neon Postgres, real BPI 2019 data)
Every phase note since Phase 9 pointed at the same unknown: this had never run against
real infrastructure. It now has. `scripts/download_bpi2019_sample.py` streams the real
729MB BPI Challenge 2019 XES file from 4TU.ResearchData and writes out the first 3,000
real cases (32K+ real events after cleaning) as CSV, closing the connection early rather
than downloading the full 251K-case file -- a genuine engineering trade-off for a
free-tier Postgres instance (Neon, 0.5GB), not synthetic data standing in for real data.

**Four real bugs found by this run, none caught by 89 passing mocked-DB tests:**
1. `load_event_log.py` -- `purchase_order_id`/`item_id` came back `int64` from a real
   CSV with bare-digit values; the data contract correctly rejected them as non-string
   IDs. Fixed by explicit `.astype("string")` on those two columns rather than relaxing
   the contract, since the contract's expectation was the correct one.
2. `run_pipeline.py`'s `if_exists="replace"` on `process_cases` failed against a real
   schema with `sla_predictions`'s FK actually in place (`DependentObjectsStillExist`)
   -- exactly the trade-off this file's own earlier notes flagged as theoretical.
   Fixed with an explicit `DROP ... CASCADE` before the replace, consistent with the
   existing "replace per run" idempotency model.
3. `src/api/db.py`'s engine had no `pool_pre_ping` -- Neon's serverless compute
   auto-suspends after idling, and the next request against a stale pooled connection
   raised `PendingRollbackError` instead of transparently reconnecting. Standard fix,
   only found because a real gap existed between two live requests for it to trigger in.
4. No `DB_SSLMODE` support anywhere a connection URL got built (`db.py`,
   `setup_database.py`, `run_pipeline.py`) -- Neon rejects unencrypted connections.
   Added as an env var (default `"prefer"`, so plain local Postgres dev is unaffected)
   rather than hardcoding an assumption either way.

Real, live results against this data: mean cycle time 2,393h, SLA-risk model trained
(logistic regression selected, ROC-AUC 0.870), `GET /health`, `/metrics/cycle-time`, and
`/metrics/bottlenecks` all confirmed working against the live Neon instance through a
real running `uvicorn` process, not TestClient. Full suite re-verified clean with no
local `.env` present (the state a real CI run would see): 89/89.

See `operations-assistant/PLAN.md`'s matching entry for the cross-project bug this run
also found (the assistant's tool client never sent `X-API-Key` to this project's now-real
auth) and the first real live agent response through the full stack.

## Post-v1.0 build session, part 3 -- Batch A complete
Closed out every item in Batch A: `check_conformance` fully vectorized (~4x, after an honest
false start), `scenario_analysis.py` built for real and hand-verified against the golden dataset,
`train.py` gained Gradient Boosting comparison and genuine time-series cross-validation
(`TimeSeriesSplit`, verified to actually produce chronologically-ordered folds, not just trusted
by name), `src/ml/retrain_trigger.py` built as real, tested decision logic for an eventual
scheduler, and CI gained a `pip-audit` job.

**That CI job found something real on its first run**: 4 CVEs in `operations-assistant`'s
`chromadb` dependency (this project doesn't use chromadb, so unaffected directly) -- see that
project's `PLAN.md` and `docs/security-notes.md` for the investigation.

Full suite: 89/89.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- real dashboard, Dockerfile, architecture diagram
Closed the last major documented gap: `dashboard/README.md` was a Power BI/Looker
build spec, never an actual built dashboard. `src/api/dashboard.py` + `dashboard.html`
now serve a real, live dashboard at `/dashboard` -- light/dark theme, Chart.js visuals,
built against the exact same `src/analytics`/`src/ml` functions the REST API already
uses, deliberately unauthenticated (same reasoning as `operations-assistant`'s
`/demo/chat`).

**Found a real performance bug while building it, on the actual live Neon deployment**:
five dashboard sections each independently re-querying `load_cases()`/`load_events()`
meant a full page load took 60+ seconds -- confirmed a plain `SELECT * FROM
staging.events` on the real 32K-row table alone exceeded a minute against Neon's
free-tier pooled endpoint. Fixed by loading each table exactly once and sharing it
across every section that needs it (5 DB round trips -> 2), plus a 120s server-side
cache, since this data only changes when the pipeline reruns. 9 new tests.

Also added: `Dockerfile` (this project's only missing one -- mirrors
`operations-assistant`'s pattern, not run against a live Docker daemon in this
environment, stated plainly), `docs/architecture.svg` replacing the README's ASCII
diagram (BigQuery path explicitly dashed/labeled as code-complete-but-unrun), and a CI
badge.

Full suite: 98/98.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- real SHAP explainability
`src/ml/explain_shap.py` adds real per-prediction SHAP values, closing the gap
`src/ml/explain.py`'s own docstring named honestly: "this is not SHAP -- it's a
lightweight approximation." The original module is kept unchanged (nothing depends
on it changing, and it needs no background dataset) -- this is additive, not a
breaking replacement. `shap.Explainer` auto-dispatches to the correct underlying
algorithm for whichever model won training (logistic regression, random forest, or
gradient boosting -- see `src/ml/train.py`'s 3-way comparison), rather than
hardcoding a specific explainer type.

4 new tests train a real model on synthetic data (same pattern as
`test_e2e_scenarios.py::_train_scenario_model`) and run real `shap.Explainer`
against it -- nothing about shap itself is mocked. Also verified directly against
the actual production model (`models/sla_risk_model.joblib`, currently
logistic_regression) and live Neon data, not just the test's synthetic set --
real SHAP values returned (e.g. `variant_frequency: -2.3155` on the log-odds scale,
correct for a linear model's LinearExplainer).

Full suite: 102/102.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- per-client API keys with named roles
`src/api/auth.py` now supports `API_KEYS` (comma-separated `name:key:role` triples)
alongside the original single-secret `API_KEY`, closing the gap the module's own
docstring named explicitly since Phase 12. Fully backward compatible -- `API_KEY`
still works (mapped to a synthetic "default" admin client), so this project's live
Render deployment's already-configured key didn't need to change.

The actual value: revoking one caller's access (a leaked key, an offboarded
integration) means removing its one entry from `API_KEYS`, not rotating a single
shared secret every caller depends on. `require_role()` exists for gating a route
to a specific role -- unused today since every route here is read-only, but real,
tested infrastructure rather than speculative scaffolding.

4 new tests (multiple clients each work independently, revoking one doesn't affect
another, a malformed entry is skipped not fatal, legacy API_KEY keeps working
alongside API_KEYS) plus the 5 original tests, all passing unchanged.

Full suite: 106/106.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- wired the retrain trigger to an actual scheduler
Closes the exact gap `src/ml/retrain_trigger.py`'s own docstring named: "No
scheduler is actually wired up in this environment." `.github/workflows/
retrain-check.yml` runs daily (`workflow_dispatch` also allows manual triggering
from the Actions tab for testing without waiting a day), calling
`scripts/check_and_retrain.py` -- which fetches the REAL current case count from
the live database (not hardcoded, unlike `retrain_trigger.py`'s own illustrative
`__main__` block) and only retrains if the existing, unchanged decision logic says
it's warranted.

Verified for real against live Neon data, not just mocked tests: fetched the
actual 3,000-case count, checked against the real model metadata (trained 0.7 days
earlier from this session's SHAP work), correctly decided no retraining was
needed. 2 new tests cover both dispatch paths (skip vs. actually retrain) with the
DB/training boundary mocked, consistent with this project's existing test style
for anything needing live infrastructure.

**Requires repo secrets to actually run on GitHub's schedule** (not something I
can set myself): `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD` as GitHub Actions
secrets on this repo, matching the live Neon credentials already in `.env`.

Full suite: 108/108.

## Post-v1.0 build session -- hyperparameter tuning + MLflow experiment tracking
`src/ml/tune.py` adds `RandomizedSearchCV`-based tuning for random forest and
gradient boosting, additive alongside `train.py`'s fixed-hyperparameter comparison
(that module's own comment named this gap: "3-model comparison with fixed
hyperparameters ... tuning doesn't yet"). `cv=TimeSeriesSplit(...)`, not sklearn's
default k-fold -- same temporal-leakage reasoning `train.py`'s own
`cross_validate_time_series` already documents.

**Real finding from actually running this against live Neon data, not just
mocked tests**: MLflow 3.x put the plain `file:./mlruns` tracking backend into
maintenance mode -- it now raises `MlflowException` unless you explicitly opt
back in or migrate to a database backend. Switched the default tracking URI to
`sqlite:///mlflow.db` (MLflow's own recommended path), still zero infrastructure
needed. Verified for real: ran tuning against the actual live case data,
`mlflow.db` created, experiment logged (best random forest params found:
`n_estimators=200, max_depth=6, min_samples_leaf=8`, cv ROC-AUC 0.953).

`scripts/tune_model.py` for manual runs -- deliberately NOT wired into the
automated retrain path (`scripts/check_and_retrain.py` keeps using `train.py`'s
fixed hyperparameters), since adopting new hyperparameters is a decision a human
should review via `mlflow ui`, not something that silently changes on every
scheduled retrain.

5 new tests: real `RandomizedSearchCV` runs against synthetic data (nothing about
sklearn's search is mocked), MLflow logging mocked separately, and a direct check
that `TimeSeriesSplit` (not k-fold) is what's actually constructed.

Full suite: 113/113.
