# Statistical significance: the "why random forest" story needed a real test, and the real test disagrees with it

Every number in this repo's model comparison — ROC-AUC 0.986 vs 0.910 — was a
single point estimate from one train/test split, with no uncertainty
attached and no test of whether the gap could be noise. That's a real gap:
"model A beats model B" said with one number each is not evidence of a
reliable difference, it's an anecdote with a metric attached. Ran
`scripts/statistical_significance.py` to close it — and it produced a result
that pushes back on this project's own headline claim, not one that
comfortably confirms it.

## 1. Bootstrap 95% CI on the deployed model's held-out ROC-AUC

Percentile bootstrap (2,000 resamples) on the fixed test-set predictions:

```
point estimate: 0.9857
95% CI: [0.9742, 0.9949]
```

This part holds up fine — the deployed random forest's 0.986 on the single
held-out split is precise, not a fluke of one lucky test set. That's not the
part in question.

## 2. Paired significance test: random forest vs. logistic regression, across the SAME 5 TimeSeriesSplit folds

This is the real test the single-split comparison never got. Same 5
chronological folds for both models (paired, not independent samples), so
the per-fold *difference* is the right quantity — a matched comparison, the
same way you'd compare two treatments on the same patients rather than two
different, unmatched groups.

```
RF fold ROC-AUC:  [0.9624, 0.8483, 0.9710, 0.9737, 0.9688]
LR fold ROC-AUC:  [0.9235, 0.9908, 0.9714, 0.9990, 0.8592]
per-fold diff (RF-LR): [+0.0389, -0.1425, -0.0004, -0.0253, +0.1096]
mean diff: -0.0039

paired t-test:          t=-0.095, p=0.929
Wilcoxon signed-rank:    W=7.000,  p=1.000
```

**Random forest wins 2 of 5 folds, logistic regression wins 2, one is
essentially tied. Neither test finds a significant difference — not close.**
This directly contradicts this README's existing "Why Random Forest? ...
random forest wins decisively (0.986 vs LR's 0.910)" framing, which was built
from exactly one train/test split (the most recent chronological chunk).

## The honest reconciliation

Both results are real; they're just measuring different things, and the
single-split number happened to land on the RF-favorable end of a
distribution that — properly measured — straddles zero:

- **The single split tests one specific time window** (the most recent ~20%
  of the data). Fold 5 in the CV breakdown above (RF 0.969, close to the
  single-split story) covers similar recent territory. Fold 2, where LR wins
  by 0.14 (0.848 vs 0.991), covers an earlier window — and it's the single
  biggest swing in either direction across all 5 folds.
- **The variance across folds is large relative to the mean difference
  between models.** RF's own fold scores range from 0.848 to 0.974 — a wider
  spread than the gap between RF and LR in most folds. That's the real
  signal here: **which model wins depends more on which time window you test
  than on which algorithm you pick**, for this feature set and this amount of
  data.
- **n=5 paired folds is genuinely small**, and both tests' exact p-values
  should be read as supporting evidence, not proof — but the small-n caveat
  cuts against overclaiming *either* direction, including the original
  "random forest wins decisively" claim, not just against this finding.

## What this changes, and what it doesn't

- **The deployed model stays random forest** — this finding is "statistically
  indistinguishable from logistic regression across time windows," not
  "logistic regression is actually better." There's no evidence-based reason
  to swap. RF also doesn't need feature scaling and handles the 541
  one-hot columns without LR's convergence warnings (see `README.md`'s
  own note on `max_iter`), which are real, non-statistical reasons to prefer
  it operationally when the accuracy case is a wash.
- **The README's "why random forest" section needed correcting, not
  deleting** — the honest version is "the single-split number that motivated
  this choice doesn't hold up under proper cross-validated comparison; the
  two models are statistically tied, and RF was kept for operational reasons
  once the accuracy argument stopped being the deciding one." That's a
  materially different, more defensible claim than "wins decisively," and a
  more honest one than quietly leaving the old claim standing next to a new
  script that contradicts it.
- **This is the same category of finding as the P3 gateway's leakage bug and
  the P2 retrieval-number corrections** — a headline number that looked
  clean because it was never tested properly, caught by actually running the
  test rather than assuming a single split generalizes.
