"""
The actual scheduled job src/ml/retrain_trigger.py's docstring named as the missing
piece: "No scheduler is actually wired up in this environment." Wired now via
.github/workflows/retrain-check.yml's cron trigger -- this script is what that
workflow runs.

Fetches the REAL current case count from the live database (not hardcoded, unlike
retrain_trigger.py's own __main__ illustrative block), calls the existing decision
logic unchanged, and retrains for real if warranted. Exits non-zero on an actual
retrain (not on "no retrain needed" -- that's the expected, common outcome, not a
failure) so a human glancing at Action run history can tell "did anything happen"
from the green/red status without opening logs, while still logging plainly either
way.

(Correction: that "non-zero on retrain" behaviour is NOT what the code does -- both
branches return 0. A red run therefore always means an error, most commonly the DB
secrets below being unset, never "a retrain happened".)
