"""
Statistical rigor pass this project didn't have: every other number in
README.md (ROC-AUC, Brier score, cost-threshold sweep) is a point estimate
with no uncertainty attached, and "random forest wins" was asserted from a
single number per model with no test of whether the gap could be noise.

Two things, both using data this pipeline already computes, no new model
training beyond what src/ml/train.py already does:

1. Bootstrap 95% CI on the deployed model's held-out ROC-AUC -- resamples the
   FIXED test-set predictions (not refitting), the standard nonparametric way
   to put an uncertainty band on an AUC computed from one held-out split.
2. A paired significance test (RF vs LR) across the SAME 5 TimeSeriesSplit
   folds `cross_validate_time_series` produces for each model -- paired
   because both models see identical train/test windows per fold, so the
   per-fold DIFFERENCE is the right quantity to test, not the two fold-score
   distributions independently. Reports both a paired t-test AND a Wilcoxon
   signed-rank test, and says plainly that n=5 folds is too small for either
   test's asymptotics to be fully trusted -- a rare, honest thing to state
   about a "p < 0.05" claim, but true here and worth saying rather than
   quoting a p-value as more certain than it is.
